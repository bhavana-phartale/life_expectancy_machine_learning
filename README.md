# life_expectancy_machine_learning
This project analyzes global health and socioeconomic data to predict life expectancy using machine learning models. It aims to identify key factors influencing life expectancy and provide accurate predictions to help policymakers and researchers.

DATASET::
The dataset includes features such as:

2.GDP per capita

3.Adult mortality rate

4.Immunization rates

5.Income composition of resources

6.Schooling years

7.And other health & demographic indicators

TECHNOLOGY USED::

1.Python 3.x

2.Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation

3.Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation

4.Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

FEATURES::
1.Data cleaning and preprocessing
2.Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3.Model training with algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.
4.Model evaluation with metrics such as RMSE, RÂ² score
5.Feature importance analysis
